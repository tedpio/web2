<p class="text-block">We have said that the computable numbers are those whose decimals are calculable by finite means.
  This requires rather more explicit definition. No real attempt will be made to justify the definitions given until
   we reach § 9. For the present I shall only say that the justification lies in the fact that the human memory is
   necessarily limited.We may compare a man in the process of computing a real number to ;i
machine which is only capable of a finite number of conditions qI;
which will be called " m-configurations ". The machine is supplied with a
"tape " (the analogue of paper) running through it, and divided into
sections (called "squares") each capable of bearing a "symbol". At
any moment there is just one square, say the r-th, bearing the symbol
which is "in the machine". We may call this square the "scanned
square ". The symbol on the scanned square may be called the " scanned
symbol". The "scanned symbol" is the only one of which the machine
is, so to speak, "directly aware". However, by altering its m-configuration
the machine can effectively remember some of the symbols which
it has "seen" (scanned) previously. The possible behaviour of the
machine at any moment is determined by the ra-configuration qn and the
scanned symbol. This pair qn, © (r) will be called the '' configuration'':thus the configuration
 determines the possible behaviour of the machines
In some of the configurations in which the scanned square is blank (i.e.
bears no symbol) the machine writes down a new symbol on the scanned
square: in other configurations it erases the scanned symbol. The
machine may also change the square which is being scanned, but only by
shifting it one place to right or left. In addition to any of these operations
	the m-configuration may be changed. Some of the symbols written down</p>
